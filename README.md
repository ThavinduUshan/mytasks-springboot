# My Tasks - Web App

This application is developed to manage my tasks and keep things organized and also to keep track of the deadlines of each task. This is a Basic CRUD application where I can view my tasks, add new tasks, update an existing one and also delete a task if needed.

This application is developed to get familiar with the spring boot framework and MongoDB database. Therefore in this application, I'm going to develop the backend API using spring boot and use a MongoDB database server to store data.
